class Arena{
  constructor(name){
    this.name = name
    this.colosseum = colosseum
    return name.charAt(0).toUpperCase() + name.slice(1);
  }
}
var colosseum = new Arena("megalopolis")
var colosseum = new Arena("colosseum")


// couldnt get the function to capitalize the first letter and couldn't find a way around it.  I worked with Chris and we were both stumped by it.
